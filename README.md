# GameAWeek-Week7

The game was made in a game jam formula where I generated or get from friends' themes and try to create a game in a week. The theme was "Strategy" so I wanted to include some RTS elements in this game and then mixed them with Tower defense.

The game goal is to destroy the enemy castle that constantly sends the troops wanting to attack the player. The player needs to gather the resources by sending workers to workplaces, train his troops, and build a tower to defend his castle from enemy attacks.
